Ruby-based Web Application which lists Open Source companies.

= Why is it important?
Knowing what other companies are in your ecosystem is important. This is no different in Open Source. You can make contacts, learn about new services and group together to reduce training costs or collaborate with each other. This is why it's key that we create a community of Open Source companies to help drive innovation and develop new exciting opportunities together.

Currently this project is in its infancy.


== Getting started
WeUseOpenSource is built on Sinatra and DataMapper. You'll need to have somethings in place before commencing development, namely

Installing the prerequisite gems
  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only ever have to do this once)
  sudo gem install sinatra datamapper data_objects do_sqlite3 uuidtools nakajima-rack-flash

Note: On Ubuntu, you will need to have libsqlite3-dev installed via apt

  sudo aptitude install libsqlite3-dev
